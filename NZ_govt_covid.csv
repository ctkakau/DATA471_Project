The Ministry of Health states that, at this stage, there is no evidence that BA.2.75 requires a shift in public health settings in place to manage other Omicron variants. Evidence on the variant’s transmissibility, immune evasiveness and severity is still preliminary and emerging. BA.2.75 has characteristics that may enhance its ability to evade immunity, similar to the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, and there is some early evidence overseas that it may be slightly more transmissible than BA.2. There is no current evidence that it leads to more severe disease, although the evidence is at a very early stage. ","(Daalder, 2022c; MOH, 2022q)",Surveillance,Surveillance

The previous advice was that people did not need to re-test if they had tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 90 days. The Ministry states the latest evidence shows that getting reinfected with COVID-19 can occur within a short period of time, and reinfection will become more likely as new variants spread among the community. If a person develops new COVID-19 symptoms and it is 29 days or more since their last infection, they should take a RAT. If they test positive, this will be considered a reinfection and they must follow the COVID-19 isolation guidelines. If the test is negative and symptoms continue, the person should take another RAT in 48 hours. Household contacts must also isolate, unless they have either had COVID-19 in the last 90 days and recovered, or have been a household contact in the last 10 days. ","(MOH, 2022p)",Testing,Testing

Further, the letter warned there was risk of existing overseas-trained employees leaving due to an inability to secure their futures as residents of New Zealand.

It identifies the ‘contextual factors, range of indicators, and baseline and response measures required to ensure that we are prepared to respond to the emergence of a new variant of concern’. It consists of a list of capabilities that will be useful in tackling any COVID-19 strain, including testing and contact tracing capacity. It also details processes for evaluating the risks from new variants and lays out five potential scenarios. As the introduction of new variants into New Zealand is difficult to predict, the plan is more broad than detailed, as different variants will have different characteristics (e.g. transmissibility, resistance to vaccines or severity of illness). One predominant concern is that officials may not have any warning of a new variant (from observing overseas), as they did with Delta and Omicron.

The amount MBIE paid each hotel varied significantly depending on the hotel, its location and occupancy. Hotels used as MIQ facilities earned an average of $1.3 million a month. As the hotels selected for MIQ needed to be near medical facilities, almost all were part of large multinational hotel chains, which has caused speculation that MIQ resulted in a large transfer of wealth from New Zealand to overseas tourism industries. The chief executive of the Hotel Council Aotearoa denies this, claiming that many foreign-branded hotels are New Zealand-owned, under franchise arrangements.

These Omicron subvariants are prevalent overseas and have been detected at the border for many weeks. Their presence in the community is not unexpected and further cases are expected. Emerging data suggests BA.2.12.1 is marginally more transmissible than BA.2, the dominant subvariant currently circulating in New Zealand. There is some clinical data to suggest the BA.5 and BA.4 subvariants have increased transmissibility compared to BA.2, but no data suggesting they cause more severe illness.","(MOH, 2022l)",Community outbreak,Outbreak

2022-04-27,High Court ruling states MIQ system breached NZBORA,"The judge in Grounded Kiwis Group Incorporated v Minister of Health [2022] holds that elements of the MIQ system were an unjustified breach of New Zealand citizens’ right of entry into New Zealand, affirmed by s 18(2) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA). Grounded Kiwis is a group that advocates for New Zealanders overseas who were impacted by the restrictions. The group challenged the restrictions between 1 September and 17 December 2021, particularly elements of the voucher system and the determination of emergency applications. The High Court finds that the MIQ system did not sufficiently allow individual circumstances to be considered and prioritised where necessary, and the mechanisms could not appropriately give effect to the right of citizens to enter; a more sophisticated system, which better prioritised those whose right to return was being unreasonably impacted, was reasonably available and would have met the Government’s public health strategy. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins responds to the judgement, stating that MIQ was ‘always the least worst option’ to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in New Zealand.

Just one of the 180 parking tickets previously issued is paid, and 40 vehicles have moved to free parking offered at Sky Stadium. Victoria University’s Pipitea campus is locked down as a result of protesters camping on the lawn and reports of intimidation and abuse. The central bus terminal is closed. A letter to Cabinet from various groups within the protest states, ‘Until the end of the mandates, participants are determined to maintain their presence.’ On 16 February, ACT leader David Seymour meets with some protesters, saying it is ‘time for dialogue’; this is condemned by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and National Party leader Christopher Luxon. On 16 February four army vehicles travel to Wellington to be pre-positioned but no decisions are made about their use. On 17 February 450 vehicles remain blocking streets surrounding Parliament. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet states the National Security Group is holding a National Security System meeting with a group of chief executives to discuss the protest, but police remain in control of the response to the protest.","(1News, 2022a; RNZ, 2022f; 2022g; 2022h)",Governance,Governance

The graph outlined the number of doses to be given each week and the dates on which different groups of people would get them. Multiple media organisations, including Stuff, requested the data behind the graph and it was later revealed that the graph was created from a non-existent data set and suggested that there were to be 2.7 million more second doses given than first doses. In December 2021, the Ombudsman’s office held that the Ministry of Health acted unreasonably in denying Official Information Act requests from media organisations regarding information about the data.

2022-02-10,Close contact exemption scheme established,"COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins and Associate Minister of Health Dr Ayesha Verrall announce a Close Contact Exemption Scheme (CCES) to help keep critical supply chains running though the Omicron outbreak. During Phases Two and Three of the Omicron response, vaccinated workers at registered critical services who are asymptomatic close contacts of a COVID-19 case will be able to continue to work, as long as they return a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) before each day/shift during the isolation period. Critical services include food production and its supply chain, key public services like health and emergency services, lifeline utilities such as power and water supplies, transport, critical financial services, news media and social welfare, and human and animal health and welfare. If at any point the worker returns a positive RAT, they will need to take a PCR test and isolate. Workers will be expected to remain in isolation outside of work hours. Businesses and organisations can register online as a critical service and must meet the criteria outlined. Workers participating in the scheme will have access to free RATs. In addition, any business or sole trader may have a worker who is a close contact on-site if they are not customer-facing and can maintain a ‘bubble of one’ while at work (including travel to and from work). They are not required to use RATs, and businesses do not need to register the bubble of one. At work, the worker must: wear a mask at all times; work in a space with no others present; travel solo, to, from and around work or between; eat alone in a well-ventilated space; use a dedicated bathroom; ensure that if symptoms develop at any stage, they follow the public advice for close contacts; and continue participating in regular workplace surveillance testing. At home, the worker must self-isolate as per usual for close contacts. ","(Hipkins & Verrall, 2022; MBIE, n.d.)",Governance,Governance
